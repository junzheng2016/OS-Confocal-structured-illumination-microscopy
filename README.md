Optical-sectioning confocal structured illumination microscopy (OS-CSIM)

Overview

We introduce the confocal imaging principle into the structured illumination microscopy and propose a optical-sectioning confocal structured illumination microscopy to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and the imaging depth of fluorescent optical sectioning imaging [papaer](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-32-18-32550&id=554913). The whole program mainly consists of three modules: (1) generate pattern for coding the sample; (2) calibrate the congjuate relationship between the spatial light modulator and the camera; (3) reconstruct confocal image.
