# Optical-sectioning confocal structured illumination microscopy (OS-CSIM)

# Overview

We introduce the confocal imaging principle into the structured illumination microscopy and propose a optical-sectioning confocal structured illumination microscopy to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and the imaging depth of fluorescent optical sectioning imaging [[papaer]](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-32-18-32550&id=554913). The whole program mainly consists of three modules:

(1) generate projection pattern; 

(2) calibrate the congjuate relationship between the spatial light modulator and the camera; 

(3) reconstruct optical-sectioning image. We have provided two reconstruction programs. One of them requires the use of dual images when reconstructing light slice images, while the other does not require the use of dual images during the reconstruction of light slice images.
